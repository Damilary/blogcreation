# TechNexus Blog: Vitest Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and timeline for migrating the TechNexus Blog testing infrastructure from Jest to Vitest. Based on the successful proof-of-concept, this migration will resolve persistent ESM compatibility issues while improving developer experience and test reliability.

## Migration Goals

1. **Resolve ESM Compatibility Issues**: Eliminate the need for complex `transformIgnorePatterns` and manual mocks
2. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Ensure no regression in test coverage during or after migration
3. **Minimize Disruption**: Allow developers to continue working without significant workflow changes
4. **Improve CI Reliability**: Eliminate flaky tests caused by Jest's ESM limitations
5. **Enhance Developer Experience**: Provide faster test runs and simpler configuration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dual Testing Setup

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:vitest": "vitest run",
    "test:vitest:watch": "vitest",
    "test:all": "npm run test && npm run test:vitest"
  },
  "vitest": {
    "environment": "jsdom",
    "include": ["**/*.vitest.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"]
  }
}
```

### Vitest Configuration

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { resolve } from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    include: ['**/__tests__/**/*.vitest.test.{ts,tsx}', '**/*.vitest.test.{ts,tsx}'],
    exclude: ['node_modules', 'dist', '.next', '.git'],
    coverage: {
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: ['node_modules/', 'src/types/'],
    },
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

### CI Pipeline Update

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Jest tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run Vitest tests
        run: npm run test:vitest
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage/
```

### Migration Process for Individual Tests

1. Create a new test file with `.vitest.test.tsx` extension
2. Convert Jest-specific APIs:
   - `jest.fn()` → `vi.fn()`
   - `jest.mock()` → `vi.mock()`
   - `jest.spyOn()` → `vi.spyOn()`
3. Update imports to include Vitest testing utilities
4. Run with `npm run test:vitest`

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk                                                   | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test functionality differences between Jest and Vitest | Medium | Medium     | Document differences, create shared utilities to abstract testing framework               |
| CI pipeline failures during transition                 | High   | Medium     | Run both test suites in parallel until migration is complete                              |
| Developer resistance to new tools                      | Medium | Low        | Provide training and documentation, emphasize improved DX                                 |
| Coverage regression                                    | High   | Low        | Monitor coverage metrics in CI, ensure tests pass in both frameworks before removing Jest |
| Timeline delays                                        | Medium | Medium     | Prioritize critical path tests, allow flexibility in later phases                         |

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass in Vitest
- Test coverage remains at or above pre-migration levels
- CI pipeline runs successfully with only Vitest
- No Jest dependencies remain in the project
- Developer feedback indicates improved testing experience

## Rollback Plan

If significant issues arise during migration:

1. Revert to Jest for affected components
2. Document specific compatibility issues
3. Create isolated fixes for critical tests
4. Re-evaluate migration strategy

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from Jest to Vitest while maintaining project velocity and test coverage. The phased approach minimizes risk while addressing the critical ESM compatibility issues that have been affecting the project.

By the end of this migration, we expect to have a more reliable, faster, and easier-to-maintain testing infrastructure that better supports modern JavaScript features.
