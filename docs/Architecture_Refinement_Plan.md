# Architecture Document Refinement Plan for TechNexus Blog

This document outlines the detailed plan to review and refine the finalized platform architecture design documents, specifically `docs/Phase1_Architecture_Decisions.md` and `docs/TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md`, to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with the implemented architectural choices (Vercel, Supabase, Meilisearch).

## Detailed Plan for Architecture Document Refinement

### Phase 1: Rectify Backend Stack and Database Schema Inconsistencies

1. **Update `TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md` - Section 1.2 "Open Source Libraries & Frameworks"**:
    * Remove `Express.js`, `Apollo Server`, and `Mongoose` from the "Backend" subsection. These are not aligned with a Supabase-centric backend.

2. **Update `TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md` - Section 4 "Database Schema Design"**:
    * Modify the schema definitions to remove MongoDB-specific terminology (e.g., `ObjectId`, "Collection"). Replace `ObjectId` with `UUID` or `ID` (as appropriate for a relational database primary key) and change "Collection" to "Table" or "Entity". The JavaScript object literal format will be retained for readability but with updated terminology.

### Phase 2: Refine System Architecture Diagram

1. **Update `TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md` - Section 3 "System Architecture Diagram"**:
    * Simplify the diagram by removing the explicit "API Gateway Layer" (APIGateway, GraphQL, REST nodes). The client will directly interact with Supabase services and Edge Functions, aligning the diagram with the more accurate representation in `docs/Phase1_Architecture_Decisions.md`.

### Phase 3: Final Review and Minor Adjustments

1. **Comprehensive Cross-check**:
    * Perform a final review of both `docs/Phase1_Architecture_Decisions.md` and `docs/TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md` to ensure all details consistently reflect the use of Vercel, Supabase, and Meilisearch.
    * Address any remaining minor ambiguities or areas that could benefit from clearer phrasing.
