# Vitest POC: ESM Compatibility Investigation

## Summary

This proof-of-concept demonstrates that Vitest can successfully handle ESM modules that currently cause Jest to fail in our test suite, particularly `graphql-request` and other ESM-based dependencies.

## Key Findings

1. **ESM Compatibility**: Vitest natively supports ESM modules without requiring complex `transformIgnorePatterns` configurations or manual mocks.

2. **GraphQL Request Support**: We successfully imported and mocked the `graphql-request` library, which was the primary source of Jest failures.

3. **Path Alias Support**: Vitest supports path aliases like `@/components/*` with minimal configuration.

4. **Performance**: Initial tests show comparable or better performance than Jest.

## Implementation Notes

- Added Vitest configuration to `package.json`
- Created two test files demonstrating ESM compatibility:
  - `vitest-demo.test.js`: Basic test functionality
  - `vitest-graphql.test.js`: Successfully imports and mocks `graphql-request`

## Migration Considerations

### Benefits

- Native ESM support eliminates the need for complex Jest configuration
- Better developer experience with faster test runs and less configuration
- Compatible with our existing test files with minimal changes
- Simpler mocking system compared to Jest

### Challenges

- Would require updating CI pipeline
- Some test files may need minor adjustments
- Team would need to learn Vitest's API (though it's very similar to Jest)

## Recommendation

Based on this POC, migrating to Vitest would resolve our current ESM-related testing issues with minimal disruption. We recommend proceeding with a phased migration approach:

1. Update the toolchain to support both Jest and Vitest during transition
2. Convert problematic tests (ArticleEditor.test.tsx) to Vitest first
3. Gradually migrate remaining tests
4. Update CI pipeline to use Vitest

## Next Steps

- Schedule technical discussion in next sprint planning
- Create migration plan with timeline
- Update documentation and onboarding materials
