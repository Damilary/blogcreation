# Navigation Implementation Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the implementation of the main navigation components for the TechNexus Blog, focusing on the `DesktopNav.tsx` and `MobileNav.tsx` components. The objective was to create a dynamic, responsive navigation system that displays categories and their sub-categories, fetching data from the Supabase backend.

## 2. Component Structure

### 2.1 `DesktopNav.tsx`

The `DesktopNav.tsx` component is responsible for rendering the primary navigation links on desktop and larger screens. It dynamically fetches categories and their associated sub-categories using GraphQL.

- **Data Fetching:** It utilizes the `useQuery` hook from `@apollo/client` to fetch data using the `GET_CATEGORIES` query.
- **Category Handling:** The fetched categories are mapped to `NavItem` objects, which include the category name, slug, and an array of its sub-categories.
- **Rendering Logic:**
  - For main navigation items that have sub-categories, a `div` with a `relative group` class is used. A button displays the category title, and on hover (`group-hover:block`), a hidden `div` appears, positioned absolutely below the button, containing links to each sub-category.
  - For main navigation items without sub-categories (or static links like 'Articles', 'About', 'Contact'), a standard `Link` component from `next/link` is rendered.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS classes are used for layout (`hidden md:flex gap-6`), typography (`text-lg font-medium`), and hover effects (`text-muted-foreground transition-colors hover:text-foreground/80`).

### 2.2 `MobileNav.tsx`

The `MobileNav.tsx` component handles the navigation for mobile devices, typically accessed via a hamburger menu.

- **State Management:** It uses the `useState` hook to manage the open/closed state of the mobile menu (`isOpen`).
- **Data Fetching:** Similar to `DesktopNav.tsx`, it fetches categories and sub-categories using `useQuery` and `GET_CATEGORIES`.
- **Category Handling:** Categories are mapped to `NavItem` objects, including their sub-categories.
- **Rendering Logic:**
  - A toggle button (using `lucide-react` icons `Menu` and `X`) controls the visibility of the mobile menu.
  - When the menu is open (`isOpen && ...`), a `div` with absolute positioning appears, covering the top part of the screen.
  - Inside this menu, each navigation item is rendered:
    - If an item has sub-categories, it uses the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements to create an expandable/collapsible section. The `summary` displays the category title, and the `details` content contains a nested `nav` with `Link` components for each sub-category.
    - If an item does not have sub-categories, a standard `Link` component is rendered.
  - Crucially, each `Link` in the mobile menu has an `onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}` handler to close the menu upon navigation, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for layout (`md:hidden`, `absolute top-16 left-0 w-full bg-background shadow-lg z-50`, `flex flex-col items-center gap-4 p-4`) and typography (`text-lg font-medium`).

## 3. Data Flow

1. **GraphQL Query:** The `GET_CATEGORIES` query is defined in `src/graphql/queries/categoryQueries.ts`. This query is designed to fetch categories along with their nested `subcategories`.
2. **Data Fetching:** Both `DesktopNav.tsx` and `MobileNav.tsx` execute this query upon component mount.
3. **State Management:** The `useQuery` hook returns `loading`, `error`, and `data`. These states are handled to display appropriate messages or render the navigation.
4. **Data Transformation:** The raw `data.categories` array is transformed into a structured `navItems` array. This array includes nested `subcategories` for each category, preparing the data for conditional rendering in both desktop dropdowns and mobile expandable sections.
5. **Rendering:** The `navItems` array is mapped to render the appropriate UI elements (links or dropdowns/expandable sections) based on the presence of sub-categories.

## 4. Responsiveness and Interaction

### 4.1 Desktop Responsiveness

- **Visibility:** The navigation is hidden on small screens (`hidden md:flex`).
- **Hover Interaction:** Main categories with sub-categories reveal their dropdown menus on hover, providing quick access to deeper content.
- **Click Interaction:** Clicking a main category without sub-categories or a sub-category navigates the user to the respective page.

### 4.2 Mobile Responsiveness

- **Visibility:** The navigation is only visible on small screens (`md:hidden`).
- **Toggle:** A hamburger menu icon toggles the visibility of the off-canvas mobile menu.
- **Expandable Sections:** Categories with sub-categories are presented as expandable `<details>` sections, allowing users to drill down into specific topics without leaving the main menu view.
- **Navigation Closure:** Clicking any navigation link (main category or sub-category) automatically closes the mobile menu.

## 5. Conclusion

The implemented navigation components successfully integrate dynamic data fetching for categories and sub-categories. The desktop version provides hover-activated dropdowns for sub-categories, while the mobile version uses expandable sections within a hamburger menu. This implementation aligns with the requirements outlined in the PRD and UI mockups, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive navigation experience across different devices.
