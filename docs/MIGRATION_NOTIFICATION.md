# Vitest Migration: Team Notification

## To: Ada (Frontend Engineer) & Funmi (QA Engineer)

## From: Bam-Bam (Codebase Evaluator)

## Re: Vitest Migration Starting Tasks

Dear Team,

I'm pleased to inform you that the Vitest proof-of-concept has been successfully completed and approved by Damilare. The POC demonstrated that Vitest can handle ESM modules that Jest struggles with, particularly `graphql-request`, which has been causing our test failures.

A comprehensive migration plan has been created and is available in `migration_plan.md`. This document outlines the phased approach we'll take to migrate from Jest to Vitest while minimizing disruption to the development workflow.

## Your Immediate Tasks

### Ada (Frontend Engineer):

1. **Create `vitest-migration` feature branch from main** (Day 1)

   - Branch from main (not the POC branch)
   - Ensure it's up to date with the latest changes

2. **Create shared test utilities for Vitest** (Days 3-5)
   - Focus on creating abstractions for common testing patterns
   - Ensure compatibility with both Jest and Vitest during the transition
   - See the migration plan for technical details

### Funmi (QA Engineer):

1. **Migrate ArticleEditor.test.tsx to Vitest** (Days 1-2)

   - This is our highest priority as it's currently failing in CI
   - Use the `.vitest.test.tsx` extension for new files
   - Follow the migration process outlined in the plan
   - Use the POC as a reference for handling ESM modules

2. **Migrate other ESM-dependent tests** (Days 3-5)
   - Identify tests that use ESM modules like `graphql-request`
   - Prioritize tests that are currently failing or flaky

## Resources

- Vitest documentation: https://vitest.dev/
- Migration plan: `migration_plan.md`
- POC findings: `VITEST-POC.md`
- Example tests: `vitest-demo.test.js` and `vitest-graphql.test.js`

Please review the migration plan and let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I'll be available to provide support throughout the migration process.

Thank you for your collaboration on this important infrastructure improvement.
