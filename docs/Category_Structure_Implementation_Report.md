# Category Structure Implementation Report

**Date:** June 30, 2025

**Authors:** Ada (Frontend Engineer), Tunde (Backend Engineer)

## 1. Objective

This report details the implementation of the initial category structure for the TechNexus Blog, covering both backend data population and frontend integration.

## 2. Initial Category List

The following main categories were identified from the `TechNexus_Blog_PRD.md` document (Section 4.1 Information Architecture):

* **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** (slug: `ai-ml`)
* **Cybersecurity** (slug: `cybersecurity`)
* **Web Development** (slug: `web-development`)
* **Mobile App Development** (slug: `mobile-app-development`)
* **Cloud Computing & Infrastructure** (slug: `cloud-computing`)
* **Gaming Technology** (slug: `gaming-technology`)
* **Consumer Electronics** (slug: `consumer-electronics`)
* **Emerging Technologies** (slug: `emerging-technologies`)

## 3. Backend Integration (Tunde's Role)

### 3.1 Data Model

The `Category` model is defined in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` as follows:

```prisma
model Category {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  name        String    @unique
  slug        String    @unique
  description String?
  image       String?   // Renamed from iconUrl and made optional for showcase
  articles    Article[] // Relation to articles

  @@map("categories")
}
```

### 3.2 Data Population Strategy

Due to the project's current phase focusing on quality assurance and refinement, direct database seeding via `npx prisma db seed` was not executed. Instead, categories should be populated using the existing GraphQL API mutations.

The `backend/src/graphql/resolvers/category.ts` file exposes the following mutations for category management:

* `createCategory(input: CreateCategoryInput!): Category!`
* `updateCategory(input: UpdateCategoryInput!): Category!`

**To populate the categories in Supabase, an authenticated user with `ADMIN` role must execute `createCategory` mutations for each category listed in Section 2.**

**Example GraphQL Mutation for `createCategory`:**

```graphql
mutation CreateAIMLCategory {
  createCategory(input: {
    name: "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",
    slug: "ai-ml",
    description: "Explore the latest in AI and Machine Learning.",
    image: "/images/ai-ml.jpg" # Placeholder image path
  }) {
    id
    name
    slug
    description
    image
  }
}
```

*(Repeat for all categories, adjusting `name`, `slug`, `description`, and `image` accordingly.)*

**Note:** Placeholder image paths (`/images/ai-ml.jpg`, etc.) are suggested. Actual image assets should be managed and linked appropriately in the CMS.

## 4. Frontend Integration (Ada's Role)

The frontend navigation components (`src/components/layout/header/DesktopNav.tsx` and `src/components/layout/header/MobileNav.tsx`) will be updated to dynamically fetch and display these categories from the Supabase API.

### 4.1 Fetching Categories

Categories will be fetched using a GraphQL query to the backend API. The `categories` query is available in `backend/src/graphql/resolvers/category.ts`:

```graphql
query GetCategories {
  categories {
    id
    name
    slug
    image
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Component Modifications

* **`src/components/layout/header/DesktopNav.tsx`**:
  * Implement logic to fetch categories on component mount.
  * Render navigation links for each fetched category.
  * Ensure clicking a category link navigates to `src/app/category/[slug]/page.tsx`.
* **`src/components/layout/header/MobileNav.tsx`**:
  * Implement similar fetching logic.
  * Render expandable sections or links for categories within the mobile menu.
  * Ensure correct navigation to category pages.

### 4.3 Category Page Placeholder

A basic placeholder page `src/app/category/[slug]/page.tsx` already exists to handle category-specific routes. This page will serve as the target for category navigation links.

## 5. Deliverables Summary

* **Backend:** `backend/prisma/seed.ts` was updated to reflect the new category list, but direct seeding was not performed. Manual population via GraphQL mutations is required.
* **Frontend:** `src/components/layout/header/DesktopNav.tsx` and `src/components/layout/header/MobileNav.tsx` will be updated to dynamically fetch and display categories.
* **Documentation:** This report (`docs/Category_Structure_Implementation_Report.md`) details the category structure and integration strategy.
